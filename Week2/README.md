# Manual Testing — Week 2

This folder contains all the artifacts created during **Week 2** of the Manual Testing Roadmap.  
The focus was on **Exploratory Testing, Bug Investigation, Test Documentation, and Regression Testing**. The activities aimed to enhance practical skills in identifying, documenting, and managing software defects.

## 📂 Files Included

- **Day1_ExploratoryTesting_Notes.pdf** → Notes on exploratory testing concepts and techniques for better understanding  
- **Day2_Negative Testing Cheat Sheet.pdf** → Reference guide for performing negative testing during exploratory sessions  
- **Day2_Exploratory_Testing_Session_Report.pdf** → Documented findings and observations from the OrangeHRM exploratory testing session  
- **Day3_BugReports_Enhanced_Colors.xlsx** → Detailed bug reports including reproduction steps, severity, priority, and status  
- **Day4_Master_Test_Case_Template.xlsx** → Master template for creating structured test cases (fields: ID, Title, Steps, Expected, Actual, Severity, Priority, Status)  
- **Day5_Regression_Checklist.xlsx** → Checklist and plan for performing regression testing on the tested DemoQA flows and OrangeHRM login module

## 🛠️ Applications Tested
- [OrangeHRM Demo](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/)  
- [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com/)  

⚠️ **Note:** Some test data (like passwords) are intentionally kept **visible** since these are practice/demo applications and not real systems. This is standard in QA learning projects.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Developed hands-on skills in **exploratory testing** and defect identification.  
- Learned to **document bugs effectively** with priority and severity.  
- Gained experience in **creating structured test cases** and templates.  
- Understood how to **plan simple regression cycles**.  
- Improved **attention to detail** and ability to consolidate QA artifacts for review.
