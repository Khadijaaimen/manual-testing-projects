# Manual Testing Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Portfolio**.  
This repository showcases my journey of learning **Manual Testing** and **Test Automation** through structured practice, projects, and self-study.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **[Week1](./Week1) → Fundamentals of Manual Testing** 
  - Test cases for OrangeHRM & DemoQA  
  - Bug reports with severity/priority labels  
  - SDLC vs STLC notes  
- *(Week2, Week3… will be added as I progress)*  

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- Writing clear and structured **Test Cases**  
- Documenting **Bug Reports** with severity & priority  
- Applying **Test Design Techniques** (EP, BVA)  
- Organizing QA artifacts in a professional format  
- Using GitHub for version control and portfolio building  

## 🧑‍💻 Applications Tested
- [OrangeHRM Demo](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/)  
- [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com/)  

⚠️ **Note**: These are practice/demo applications. Some test data (e.g., passwords) are intentionally visible since this is for QA learning purposes only.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repo is meant to:
- Practice real-world QA documentation standards  
- Build a portfolio for recruiters and hiring managers  
- Show progression from **manual testing → automation**

✅ More weeks and automation projects will be added as I continue my learning.
